//A method that some companies implement is to use letter to display their telephone
//numbers. For example, if a person requires emergency services, the number 555-8931
//indicates HELP_NEED.
//You need to create a function that allows the user to enter a telephone number in
//the form of letter and the function must print the prompted telephone number in
//digits. The first seven letters need to be considered only. The hyphen needs to be put
//after the 4th digit as well.
